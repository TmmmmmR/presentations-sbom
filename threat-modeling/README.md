## Overview
This is intended to be a 3 part series with each part lasting approximately 2
hours after accounting for a 5-10 minute break after the first 45-55 minutes or
so as well as all of the breakout group exercises.

Part 1 is finished. For the short term at least, for Parts 2 and 3, I am just
going to use the excellent threat modeling training slide decks over at
https://github.com/segmentio/threat-modeling-training. Those are restricted to
"non-commercial" use, but the overall approach (division into 3 parts, lecture
mixed with hands-on exercises, length of each part, etc. I lifted from there
after hearing a talk by [Jeevan Singh](https://github.com/segment-jsingh). So,
shout-out to @segment-jsingh for that.

- **kwwall-stride-tm-part1.mp4** - A video of the first presentation (held via Zoom) with a small audience of friends / former colleagues who promised to provide honest feedback and not interrupt me with farting noises _during_ the presentation. Fortunately, for all of you who decide to watch it, there is no video of my face so you shouldn't have to worry too much about ensuing nightmares.
