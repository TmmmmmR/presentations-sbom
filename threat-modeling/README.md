## Overview
This is intended to be a 3 part series with each part lasting approximately 2
hours after accounting for a 5-10 minute break after the first 45-55 minutes or
so as well as all of the breakout group exercises.

Part 1 is finished. For the short term at least, for Parts 2 and 3, I am just
going to use the excellent threat modeling training slide decks over at
https://github.com/segmentio/threat-modeling-training. Those are restricted to
"non-commercial" use, but the overall approach (division into 3 parts, lecture
mixed with hands-on exercises, length of each part, etc. I lifted from there
after hearing a talk by [Jeevan Singh](https://github.com/segment-jsingh). So,
shout-out to @segment-jsingh for that.

  
## Important Note
If you try to clone (or probably fork) this repository, it may fail to download the
mp4 file as the repository is using Git LFS for storing it. If the monthly downloads exceeds about 4 per
month, the bandwidth for the free version will be exceeded. So don't be the reason why others can't have
nice things. If it becomes a problem, I shall simply remove it. If you want to download it, use the link
provided below in the 'Contents' section! Thanks for your cooperation.

## Contents
- **kwwall-stride-tm-part1.odp** - The original slide deck, created with LibreOffice 7.4 Impress
- **kwwall-stride-tm-part1.pdf** - The above file, converted to Adobe Portable Document Format.
- **kwwall-stride-tm-part1.pptx** - The original .odp file, converted to Microsoft PowerPoint format.
- **[kwwall-stride-tm-part1.mp4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ian_EgdUfAS3eFxZEfjLR5ysmtToidTR/view?usp=sharing)** - A video of the first presentation (held via Zoom) with
  a small audience of friends / former colleagues who promised to provide honest feedback and not interrupt
  me with farting noises _during_ the presentation. The video lasts 1 hour and 48 minutes. Fortunately, for
  all of you who decide to watch it, there is no video of my face so you shouldn't have to worry too much 
  about ensuing nightmares. The link to the file provided in this **README.md** file is a link to my personal
  Google Drive. It should allow you to directly watch the video from there. (I tried to upload it to
  YouTube and it told me it was too large; go figure.)
